# Diabetis-Data-Prediction
I'm working on a Python project to build a system that predicts whether an individual has diabetes using machine learning. Specifically, I'm using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for this task. The goal is to create a reliable system that can accurately classify individuals as either having diabetes or not based on relevant data.
